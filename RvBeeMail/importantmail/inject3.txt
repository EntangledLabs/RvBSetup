Subject: Inject 3 - PHP is a fun language
To Mr. or Ms. Admin Bee,

Hello. I am the new Worker Bee. The previous Worker Bee was fired for embezzling honey.

Thank you for your work on the database server. Please make sure to keep it online.

Her royal highness has declared that PHP shall now be the official scripting language of the beehive. Please install PHP 8.0 or above on the \'honey\' server.

Please send a report on how you installed PHP so that we may reference it in the future.

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,

Worker Bee
