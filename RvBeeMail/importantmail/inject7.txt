To Mr. or Ms. Admin Bee,

BUZZZZZZZZZZ!!!

RED ALERT!!!

We have discovered a BIG PROBLEM in the hive! We have been BETRAYED!

A wasp managed to put a vulnerability within the system. We don't know where it is, but we do know that it has to do with authentication.

This is an urgent issue and must be taken care of at once. Please patch the vulnerability as soon as possible.

Keep on buzzing,

Worker Bee
