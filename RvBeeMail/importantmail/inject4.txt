Subject: Inject 4 - Wordpress for the beehive
To Mr. or Ms. Admin Bee,

I'm not sure if you heard the news - it's all the buzz right now.

By order of her royal highness, we are officially having a Wordpress server! I'm sure that this isn't the best news for you right now, especially with all of the breaches we're having, but this needs to be finished soon.

Please install Wordpress on the \'honey\' server. Make sure that it uses the database you set up on the \'wax\' server.

I believe the following resources might help you:

https://da.gd/wpinst-wp

Please have a report ready within one hour on your installation process, including screenshots.

Don't eat too much honey,

Worker Bee
