Subject: Database for the beehive
To Mr. or Ms. Admin Bee,

Thank you for the SWIFT work! We will start monitering the webserver, please make sure that it stays up!

By order of her royal highness, Queen Bee, the hive must have a database server to store information from our website. Please install MySQL Server or MariaDB on the \'wax\' server.

The Queen wants to prepare to have a Wordpress blog, so please make sure to have a \'wordpress\' user with our default password. In addition, please have a \'wordpress\' database on the server that we can use in the future.

I expect your report on the setup process within one hour. Please include screenshots!

Get busy,

Worker Bee
